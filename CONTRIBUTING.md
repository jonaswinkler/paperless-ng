# Contributing

There's still lots of things to be done, just have a look at that issue log. If you feel like conctributing to the project, please do! Bug fixes and improvements to the front end (I just can't seem to get some of these CSS things right) are always welcome.

If you want to implement something big: Please start a discussion about that in the issues! Maybe I've already had something similar in mind and we can make it happen together. However, keep in mind that the general roadmap is to make the existing features stable and get them tested. See the roadmap in the readme.

* When making additions to the project, consider if the majority of users will benefit from your change. If not, you're probably better of forking the project.
* Also consider if your change will get in the way of other users. A good change is a change that enhances the experience of some users who want that change and does not affect users who do not care about the change.

## Python

Paperless supports python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9.

## Branches

master always reflects the latest release. Apart from changes to the documentation or readme, absolutely no functional changes on this branch in between releases.

dev contains all changes that will be part of the next release. Use this branch to start making your changes.

feature-X branches is for experimental stuff that will eventually be merged into dev, and then released as part of the next release.

## Testing:

I'm trying to get most of paperless tested, so please do the same for your code! I know its a hassle, but it makes sure that your code works now and will allow us to detect regressions easily.

To test your code, execute `pytest` in the src/ directory. Executing that in the project root is no good. This also generates a html coverage report, which you can use to see if you missed anything important during testing.

Before you can run `pytest`, ensure to install `pytest-xdist` and `pytest-cov` by running `pip3 install pytest-xdist pytest-cov`.
